<h3>Current Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Currently, Chatbot Lite uses on online interpreter to embed the Python code into HTML.
    This causes some of the Chatbot functions to rely on the location of the server that the online interpreter
    is in rather than the location of the computer used to launch the site.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Try it on your own!</h3>
<ul>
<li>Copy the chatbotLite.py code into a new Python file in order to try the application on your own computer! 
    This also solves the online interpreter location problem as the function will use your own computer's location.
</li>
</ul>
